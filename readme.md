### 1. **Project Setup & Data Loading**  
- Loaded and explored the dataset structure, size, and data types. 

### 2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
- Addressed missing values and ensured proper data types. 
- Handled outliers to improve analysis accuracy. 

### 3. **Univariate & Bivariate Analysis**  
- Examined distributions of scores, budgets, and revenues.  
- Analyzed relationships between key variables like budget, revenue, and scores. 

### 4. **Genre-Specific Analysis**  
- Identified popular genres and their average scores.  
- Visualized how genre trends evolved over time.

### 5. **Yearly & Decadal Trends**  
- Explored changes in scores and movie releases across decades. 
- Investigated decade-based patterns in movie production.  

### 6. **Insights & Summary**  
- Highlighted trends in genres, ratings, and release patterns.  
- Suggested new questions and data to explore.
